**Project Name: WebCam Encryption**


**Description:**

This project aims to create a web application where users can take pictures or record videos using their webcam. Once the user completes the activity, the captured media (picture or video) is encrypted and saved securely in a database.

**Features:**

- **Webcam Integration:** Users can access their webcam directly from the web page.
- **Capture Media:** Users can take pictures or record videos using the webcam.
- **Encryption:** Captured pictures and videos are encrypted using advanced encryption standards to ensure data security.
- **Database Storage:** Encrypted media is securely stored in a database for future access.

**Learning Experience:**

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into encryption techniques, particularly in the context of securing multimedia data. The project allowed me to explore and implement advanced encryption standards using the CryptoJS library in React. 

**Technologies Used:**

- React.js
- CryptoJS
- HTML/CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` in both backend and frontend.
3. Run the application using `npm start` for backend and for the frontend run the application using `npm run dev`.
4. Access the application in your web browser.
